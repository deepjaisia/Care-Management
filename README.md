# CareManagement

Due to PHI I cannot share the actual code but I have included the screenshots of the application. I worked on the application as whole from the the front-end to the back-end and everything in between.

(HTML5, SASS, CSS3, Angular4, MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Azure Portal, Git, Jira)

1. Web Application using Agile Methodology which is used by the ‘Care Givers’ to keep a record of all the prescribed patients. 
2. Surveys were distributed using “Survey Monkey” and consists of a login systems for the physicians.
3. Used REST API to gather the surveys and the responses for different patients and map the answers of a response to the survey questions. 
4. Hosted the web application, REST services and Mongo DB on Azure Portal.
5. Created a dashboard with all the patients information and a personalized “Patient View” for each of the patient with their responses.
