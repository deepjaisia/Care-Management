# Care-Management

Due to PHI I cannot share the actual code but I have included the screenshots of the application.

1. Web Application using Agile Methodology which is used by the ‘Care Givers’ to keep a record of all the prescribed patients. 
2. Surveys were distributed using “Survey Monkey” and consists of a login systems for the physicians.
3. Used REST API to gather the surveys and the responses for different patients and map the answers of a response to the survey questions. 
4. Hosted the web application, REST services and Mongo DB on Azure Portal.
5. Created a dashboard with all the patients information and a personalized “Patient View” for each of the patient with their responses.
